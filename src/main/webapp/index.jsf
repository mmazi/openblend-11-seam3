The contents of this file will not be displayed!

Having this file is a trick to get JBoss AS to redirect to the path index.jsf
when the root application URL is requested (or any subdirectory).

See https://issues.jboss.org/browse/JBAS-8224

If you are using other containers, such as Glassfish, this file will be ignored and you may delete at will.
