This is the code from the demo at the OpenBlend 2011 conference ( http://www.openblend.org/sl/povzetki#mazimatija )
and the talk in Kiberpipa ( http://www.kiberpipa.org/sl/event/razvoj-spletnih-aplikacij-v-java-ee-6-in-seam-3-1441/ ).

I've written some comments here:

When you start the application, you can see it at http://localhost:8080/index.jsf .

If you have any questions just contact me, I'll be glad to help!
